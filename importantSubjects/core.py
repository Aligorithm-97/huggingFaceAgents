"""

Why Use smolagents – smolagents is an open-source agent framework, offering alternatives like LlamaIndex and LangGraph. This module explores its advantages and drawbacks to help you choose the right framework for your project.

CodeAgents – CodeAgents generate executable Python code instead of text or JSON, enabling automation and task execution. This module covers their purpose, functionality, and hands-on examples.

ToolCallingAgents – Unlike CodeAgents, ToolCallingAgents generate JSON or text for external system execution. This module explains their functionality, differences from CodeAgents, and provides practical examples.

Tools – Tools act as function-based building blocks for agents, enhancing their capabilities. This module covers tool creation, implementation methods, the default toolbox, and how to share or load community tools.

Retrieval Agents – These agents enable models to access and retrieve information from knowledge bases using vector stores and RAG techniques. This module covers implementation strategies and fallback mechanisms for robust data retrieval.

Multi-Agent Systems – Combining different agents enhances AI-driven solutions. This module focuses on designing, implementing, and managing multi-agent systems for improved efficiency and reliability.

Vision and Browser Agents – Vision agents use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for image-based reasoning and multimodal interactions. This module explores their integration, including building browser agents for web data extraction.

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) extends traditional RAG systems by combining autonomous agents with dynamic knowledge retrieval.

While traditional RAG systems use an LLM to answer queries based on retrieved data, agentic RAG enables intelligent control of both retrieval and generation processes, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Traditional RAG systems face key limitations, such as relying on a single retrieval step and focusing on direct semantic similarity with the user’s query, which may overlook relevant information.
